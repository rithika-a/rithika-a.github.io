The following are excerpts from the journal entries of M. tuberculosis, a master infiltrator. Proceed with caution; it knows all your defenses.

## [Day 0 — 12:00] Arrival

A single breath — that’s all it took.

No one ever noticed me. A woman on the train brushed her hair out of her face, and at that moment, a speck of saliva from a stranger’s cough made contact with her fingertips. She yawned, rubbed her eyes, then touched her lips. Just like that, I was in. 

My name is Mycobacterium tuberculosis — M. tb, if you’re into brevity. I’m not a virus, like Influenza or SARS-CoV-2. I’m a bacterium — a slow-moving, slow-growing kind of operator, but don’t mistake that for weakness. I’ve been infecting humans for tens of thousands of years, responsible for a disease they call Tuberculosis, my namesake and my life’s work. I’m patient, durable, and strategic. And I don’t need to burn down the body to get what I want. I just need a quiet corner to build in.

## [Day 0 — 13:30] Entry

The human lungs are a dream landscape for a microbe like me: warm, moist, nutrient-rich, and mostly undefended. I settled into the lower respiratory tract and took stock. Every surface was coated in mucus, every pocket rich with oxygen. My target was nearby — a macrophage, one of the immune system’s street level enforcers. 

Macrophages are big, blobby cells that roam the body looking for things that don’t belong. They eat first and ask questions later – just the kind of impulsivity I rely on. Upon seeing me, she surged towards me like a slow tide and wrapped herself around me. I didn’t struggle and that’s what she expected — for me to panic, to flail, to die. To her, it looked like she had neutralized a threat.

But I was built for this. 

Unlike many bacteria, I’m wrapped in a waxy armor made of mycolic acids — thick, greasy molecules that coat my outer shell. That’s my signature feature. This armor makes me tough  to digest, impossible to break down with acid, and hard to recognize. I was swallowed whole, yes, but inside her digestive compartments I didn’t dissolve. I endured. 

But better than that, I took control. I stopped the acid from forming, blocked the enzymes, and rewired her internals. She became my base of operations. My new home. And soon, my factory.

## [Day 2 — 16:00] Expansion

Inside the macrophage, I began to replicate slowly and methodically. I don’t multiply like a virus — there’s no explosive takeover. I divide by binary fission, one careful copy at a time. It’s not flashy, but it’s reliable. Every copy I produce is an exact replica, built for stealth and survival. I’m an engineer, not a berserker. What I lack in speed, I make up for in resilience. 

At first, the macrophage tolerated it. She had no choice since I had silenced her distress signals. As far as the immune system knew, everything was fine. But macrophages weren’t designed to host guests like me. Over time, the burden became too much. My presence disrupted her function, taxed her metabolism, and oftentimes she died through apoptosis or bursting from the inside out. 

When that happened, it was no accident. It was an exit strategy. 

Her death allowed me to spill into the surrounding lung tissue. Now free, I was ready to infect new cells. I also wasn’t alone anymore — now I had several identical copies of myself, all ready to infect alongside me. Other nearby macrophages came rushing in, thinking they were cleaning up the mess. And just like before, they swallowed me whole, unaware they were feeding the fire. 

That’s how I spread — by leapfrogging from one misguided immune cell to the next. Each one thought it was containing the problem. But each one became another base under my control. 

I wasn’t just surviving, I was expanding.

And every dead macrophage? Another open door.

## [Day 6 — 10:00] Exposure

I felt untouchable, gliding effortlessly through enemy lines. I was at the peak of my mission. Every move was flawless, every second a victory.

Then, without warning, the tide began to turn.

One of my corrupted macrophages, older and overworked, began to fail. I had suppressed her alarm signals as best as I could, but something slipped. A few distress molecules leaked into the surrounding tissue. Her final Hail Mary: little chemical whispers that said, “Something is wrong here.”

That’s when _she_ showed up. 

Not a fighter. Not a cleaner. A dendritic cell, the immune system’s intelligence agent. Drawn in by the danger signals, she arrived to investigate the scene. She didn’t engage. She didn’t even stay long. Just slipped in, scooped up parts of me — pieces of my cell wall, surface proteins, antigens from the infection site — and vanished into the lymphatic channels as quickly as she came. 

Taking pieces of me didn’t faze me. I had countless copies already, and dividing was second nature. What unsettled me was the question of where she was headed, and what she planned to do with what she carried.

She didn’t seem to have done much, so I eventually dismissed it. What I didn’t know was that she was headed straight to headquarters. The lymph node. Dendritic cells don’t fight. They warn. They carry evidence to the lymph nodes, the war room, where immune commanders gather. There, she’d present a piece of me like a wanted poster and say: find this. 

And someone would listen.

## [Day 14 — 9:30] Encounter

Nothing happened for several days after that scout came by. Just yesterday, I thought that maybe there wasn’t anything to worry about. 

But today, they descended. 

Not patrols this time… these were T-cells, precision fighters designed to recognize the descriptions of my surface molecules relayed by the dendritic cells. They weren’t guessing, they knew exactly what to look for. 

They attacked the macrophages I was hiding in. Burst them open and killed the cells I had worked so hard to turn into factories. These weren’t simple foot soldiers, they were assassins trained to destroy their own kind if it meant stopping an intruder like me. 

But I had tricks too. I released chemical inhibitors to jam their signals. I delayed their reinforcements. I interfered with how the infected macrophages cried for help. But when the body realized it couldn’t defeat me, it did something else… unexpected.

 It started building walls.

## [Day 21 — 16:00] The Fortress

The immune system called in every unit it had. T-cells, B-cells, more macrophages. Together, they built multiple fortresses around me and all my copies. They stacked immune cells in layers, wrapping infected tissue in a dense cage of flesh and pressure. They sealed off the zone like a military quarantine. 

This structure has a name: a granuloma. To the immune system it’s a cage, but to me it’s a bunker. Although temporarily disabled, inside these walls I am safe from antibiotics, detection, and destruction. Although not ideal, I can use this to my advantage. So I go quiet, reducing my metabolism to almost nothing. I sleep. 

I don’t need to kill the host, I just need to wait. Because sometimes, the immune system weakens. Age, stress, and malnutrition among many other factors. Just one crack in the wall, one missed patrol, and I’ll wake up. 

And when I do, I’ll spread fast. Fill the lungs with fluid and trigger a cough that sends me airborne again. Because that’s the final stage of my operation. Transmission. 

That’s what I train for. That’s what all of us train for. Not just to live inside one host.

But to escape.
To move forward.
To infect the next.

This story uses personification for narrative and educational purposes only. In reality, pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis do not possess thoughts, intentions, or consciousness. Bacteria and viruses are not "evil" — they are non-sentient biological entities that evolve to survive and reproduce in their environments. While personifying microbes can help illustrate complex immune processes in a relatable way, it is important to remember that this is a storytelling device, not a scientific assertion. Always approach infectious diseases with empathy for the host and accuracy in the biology.

This piece is intended solely for science communication and should not trivialize or diminish the real impact of Tuberculosis, which remains one of the world’s deadliest infectious diseases. In 2022 alone, M. tb caused over 10 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths globally, according to the World Health Organization. The intent here is to inform and engage, not to make light of illness or those affected by it.
