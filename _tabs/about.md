Hello and welcome! My name is Rithika Adavikolanu, and I have been an academic researcher for 6 years across a variety of fields. I'm currently a research specialist in the Krogan Lab at The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where I study host-viral protein interactions using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. My research interests include infectious disease pathogenesis, host-pathogen protein-protein interactions, and cellular adaptation under pathogen infection.

I am also very passionate about science communication and mentorship, and as part of this website, I have an embedded blog to communicate science to the general public. I believe that the discoveries we make as scientists are meant to be shared with the world, not just kept in academic circles. 

Outside of the lab, I enjoy playing with my dog, being outdoors in nature, cooking new recipes, and taking care of my houseplants. 

Thanks for stopping by -- I hope you enjoy reading about me and my work, and I look forward to connecting with you!
