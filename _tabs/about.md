Hi and welcome -- my name is Rithika! I’m a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), with six years of academic research experience across a variety of fields. My scientific interests center around infectious disease pathogenesis, host-pathogen protein-protein interactions, and how cells adapt under the stress of infection. In short: I love studying the molecular tug-of-war between hosts and pathogens.

Beyond the lab bench, I’m deeply passionate about science communication and mentorship. I believe science is meant to be shared — not just in academic journals, but with everyone. As part of this website, I have created a blog to break down complex research into stories that spark curiosity, understanding, and connection.

When I’m not pipetting or writing, you’ll likely find me hanging out with my dog, experimenting in the kitchen, getting outdoors to hike or camp, watching sports, or gently apologizing to my struggling houseplants.

Thanks for stopping by — I hope you enjoy exploring my work, and feel free to reach out via email!
